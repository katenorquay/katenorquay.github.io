    <p>
      Some of the techniques I’ve been trying this week are timeboxing and pomodoro, and I’ve also been trying to learn to ask for help if I need to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a big to do list girl, like honestly if I don’t to do list stuff like ‘have breakfast’ I just don’t do them and then I’m like why the fuck am I so hungry. So I’m really loving waffle and toggle cos now I can have even more to do list related information! And I know that I have to split stuff down into small steps and cross them off to keep me focused. The pomodoro technique works really well for this, cos I can split stuff down into 25min steps and feel like I am accomplishing things at a rapid-ish pace.

      Timeboxing and asking for help are other things I’ve found really useful. Usually I swing between two things, trying to do everything myself and then raging when I can’t, or giving up as soon as I see a problem and leaning on people for help. This week I tried an idea I saw on twitter: ‘If you have a problem try to fix it yourself for 15mins and if you can’t you have to ask for help.’ So if I get stuck I set an alarm on my phone and try to fix it until it goes off. I did this when I couldn’t get my freaking fruit to move folders.
    </p>
    <p>I’d like to experiment more with building habits, I really like the idea that you don’t need heaps of motivation to build a habit, you just need to decide what comes before it. I could use this one to make sure I get up earlier, the habit being to get out of bed as soon as the alarm goes off. It’s a big challenge for me but I gonna do it before bootcamp, otherwise I’ll be absolutely insufferable. </p>
    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
