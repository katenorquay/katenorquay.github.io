      This week we focused on valuing process over product. I find this method a bit difficult, because if something doesn't look right I just want to work on it until it does. I think the important thing is to keep trying new things and looking for challenges, even if your execution is average.

      I've always quite liked the idea of meditation, but have never given it much of a go as I don't struggle with anxiety or stress too much, and I didn't want to take time each day to sit and 'do nothing'. I had a friend in Santiago who really loved it, but she was one of the most stressed people I've ever met so I was like ????, but then I saw her on a day she hadn't meditated and she was 100% worse so I got it.

     I liked chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself, cos I can more clearly see the medical benefits of meditation and the science behind why it works, rather than the usual spiritual/religious implications which didn't appeal to me as much. I didn't realise how much it could help with productivity, or with controlling impluses. I particularly liked the analogy of a blade of grass which moves in the wind but stays centered.
