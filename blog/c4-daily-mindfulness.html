     I gave the mindfulness conversation a go with my boyfriend and it was pretty cool! I liked doing the attentive listening, because it's an easy way to feel close to someone. Using the looping technique made me realise how easy it is to misunderstand someone. It's not intentional, but your emotions or pattern matching with old experiences makes it easy to hear things that weren't actually said. I think we both felt like we knew each other a little better afterwards.

      I also really liked the idea of joyful meditation, where you focus your attention on joyful experiences as they are happening, in order to appreciate them more. This seems like a fun way to practice meditation, and a good way to improve mental health.

      I want to try having a meditation buddy this week, maybe someone in the course? Cos I like the ideas I'm reading, but I'm not really practising much because I get caught up focusing on code. Some accountability would help me practice more.
