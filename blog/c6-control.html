      I found this weeks chapter really interesting, particuarly the bit about grasping and aversion(desperately holding onto things, or aggressively pushing things away). The book said that those two things account for a huge percentage of pain we experience, and I think that's completely true, but I'd never thought about it in that way.

      I think my main programming trigger is not understanding instructions. If I'm coding independently and I don't understand I'm usually happy to google and use program solving techniques, but this week when I was struggling with the first part of the minesweeper game I felt really crap because I wasn't sure what to do or even what to google. I get irritable and stop communicating because I feel guilty, which only makes it harder to solve the problem.

      Helpful realisation: I think my trigger is probably feeling powerless. I think the signs of it for me are butterflies in my stomach, not talking, or responding briskly to people and feeling dizzy.

      I like the idea of the Siberian North Railroad exercise, but I haven't done it yet cos I'm having a hard week so I wanna focus on the positive, rather than thinking about triggers. Might be the perfect time for joyful meditation!
