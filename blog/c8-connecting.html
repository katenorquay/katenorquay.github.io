        I found this weeks reading kinda hard to relate to, I think mainly because I've never had a 'proper' job. I've worked on group projects, like plays and films, but I usually work with my friends so I never have any problem with trusting them, or assuming they are good people. I've also had jobs in hospitality where I've cared so little about the work that I didn't see much point in building trust with co-workers. I'm excited that EDA will be my first chance to work with a new group of people on projects that matter to me.

        Empathic Listening and Kindness Meditation were both cool, and did make me feel closer to the people I talked/thought about. I like the idea that 'kindness is a sustainable source of happiness'. I also thought that the insight about feedback - that people respond better to praise about their process rather than intelligence was great. I've often felt this way, but haven't put it into words before.

        My political awareness example is this tragic time my dad (Kevvo) freaked out because my room was untidy a couple of weeks ago.

      <h3 class="blog-heading">My Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        Kev is over-reacting. My room is usually clean, he is freaking out over an unmade bed. He shouldn't be going into my room when I'm not there, and he should trust me to look after my space. He should treat me like an adult.

       <h3 class="blog-heading">Kevvo's Perspective</h3>
       <p>
        Kate isn't looking her room properly, even though we are letting her stay in our house for free. We are trying to sell the house, and she isn't making an effort to make it easier for us. If she wants to be treated like an adult then she has to act like one.
